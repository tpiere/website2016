        Hello! I'm a friendly web developer living in Austin, Texas. I've been working as a software developer and front-end engineer
        for the past 10 years since graduating from college.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy working with user experience and graphic designers to build high quality interfaces on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        I care about developing quality, well-tested code that is loosely coupled and maintainable. Those are lofty goals for any
        project, but I am constantly trying to find ways to write better code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside work, I enjoy music, sports, movies, travelling, and learning about anything interesting. I also love coffee, beer,
        and whiskey. <md-icon>thumb_up</md-icon>
